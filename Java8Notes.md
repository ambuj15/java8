# SUMMARY:-

	With the introduction of Java 8, **functional Programming**(Style of programming that treats **computation as functions/expressions** and avoid changing state) has been introduced in the Java Langauge.
	Java 8 has introduce **Lambda Expression** to bring the benefits of functional Programming in java, Lambda is just a **nameless function, which means it does not have name, return Type and access modifier.** 
	Java 8 has introduce **Functional Interface** to bring the use of lambda expression. Functional Interface is having *Single Abstract Method(SAM)* in it. To mark an interface Function an **annotation has been introduce i.e. @FunctionalInterface.** 
	Java 8 has also added **method Reference** which enables us to define lambda expressions by referring to methods name directly.
	Java 8 has also introduce **default concrete methods(extension method or defender methods) and static methods inside interface**. 
	Java 8 has introduce **java.util.function** package which consititue **all functional interfaces** like Predicate, Function, Supplier, Consumer, BinaryOperator, UnaryOperator.
	Java 8 has introduce **stream functionality** with java.util.stream packageâ€“ which contains classes **for processing sequence of elements.** This is done by Stream pipeline chaining - 
		Syntax:- "source (.) 0 or more Intermidiate Operation (.) Terminal operation". Intermediate operation like - filter, map, skip, peek, sorted, distinct etc while  Terminal operation like for each(Consumer), reduce, collect, toArray, findFirst, findAny, count etc.
	Java 8 has added a final class **Optional** in java.util package, which helps us to write **neat code without worrying about too many null checks.**
	Java 8(HotSpot 1.8) has also **removed PremGen memory space and introduce MetaSpace** just to avoid java.lang.OutOfMemoryError.
	Java 8 has introduced Nashorn javascript engine, which is a java based engine for executing and evaluting java Script Code.
	Java 8 has also added **java.time packages** to enhance java Date and Time Api features. Classes are -  LocalDate, LocalDateTime, Clock
	Java 8 has also introduced **StringJoiner class in util package**. Using this class we can join more than one strings with the specified delimiter, we can also provide prefix and suffix to the final string while joining multiple strings. 
		[StringJoiner Example](https://beginnersbook.com/2017/10/java-8-stringjoiner/)
	Java 8 has added **forEach(Consumer) and spiltIterator() methods in the Iterable Interface**.
	Local inner class(which are dfined inside a methods) **cannot access non-final local variable** till JDK 1.7, Since JDK 1.8, it is possible to access the non-final local variable in method local inner class.
	Java 8 has introduced **StampedLock**, in which the acquisition method return a stamp that is used to release a lock and to check whether lock is still valid or not.
	java 8 has introduced Concurrent Adders & Accumulators- DoubleAdder, DoubleAccumulator, LongAdder, LongAccumulator


**Java -8 Pre-Defined functional interfaces**

Pre-Defined functional interfaces are introduced in order to make programming easy and these are some common interfaces with some methods which can be used in daily programs and hence we don't need to create multiple functional interfaces separately. 
  We can use any pre-defined FI depending on the usage and type of method we need.

You can find all these pre-defined functional interfaces in *java.util.function* package

*1. Single argument pre-defined functional interfaces*
a) Predicate
b) Function
c) Consumer
d) Supplier

*2. Double argument pre-defined functional interfaces*
a) BiPredicate
b) BiFunction
c) BiConsumer

*3. Primitive functional interfaces*

a) IntPredicate
b) IntFunction
c) IntConsumer

======================================================================================================================

**Predicate** : We use predicate whenever we need conditional checks. Hence it is clear that it will return boolean value. 

e.g : 
```import java.util.function.Predicate;

public class PredicateExample {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		// Checking for even number
		Predicate<Integer> p = i -> i % 2 == 0;
		System.out.println(p.test(10));

		// Check length of string is greater than 5 or not
		Predicate<String> p1 = s -> s.length() > 5;
		System.out.println(p1.test("BholeNath"));
		
		// Print the names whose length is more than 5 characters
		
		String[] s = { "Ambuj", "Apoorva", "ShivShankar", "Kusum" };
		Predicate<String> p3 = name -> name.length() > 5;
		for (String s1 : s) {
			if (p3.test(s1)) {
				System.out.println(s1);
			}
		}

	}

}

o/p: 
true
true
Apoorva
ShivShankar
```
*Predicate Joining :* This is a facility provided by java by which we can combine predicates to form one single predicate in order to simplify the complex conditional checks

-- p1--> predicate to check whether number is even or not

-- p2--> predicate to check whether number is greater than 10 or not

a) p1.and(p2).test(34) -- This will check whether 34 is even and is greater than 10 or not.

b) p1.or(p2).test(34) -- This will check if 34 is even or greater than 10 or not.

c) p1.negate() -- This will be used find opposite of p1.

Eg:

```
public class PredicateExample {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
	int[] a = { 10, 20, 5, 25, 30, 42, 64, 55 };
		System.out.println("--------------Numbers are even and greater than 10--------------------");
		Predicate<Integer> p4 = pJ1 -> pJ1 % 2 == 0;
		Predicate<Integer> p5 = pJ2 -> pJ2 > 10;
		for (int a1 : a) {
			if (p4.and(p5).test(a1)) {
				System.out.println(a1);
			}
		}
		System.out.println("--------------Numbers are even or greater than 10--------------------");
		for (int a1 : a) {
			if (p4.or(p5).test(a1)) {
				System.out.println(a1);
			}
		}
		System.out.println("--------------Numbers are not even--------------------");
		for (int a1 : a) {
			if (p4.negate().test(a1)) {
				System.out.println(a1);
			}
		}

	}
	
Output:

--------------Numbers are even and greater than 10--------------------
20
30
42
64
--------------Numbers are even or greater than 10--------------------
10
20
25
30
42
64
55
--------------Numbers are not even--------------------
5
25
55
```

============================FUNCTION==============================

**Function** : We use function whenever we want to perform any operation on the input argument not just conditional check but a valid operation (add, sub, etc) and get some output then in that case we use function.


 Eg: **input --> perform operation --> output.** 

 
 *Synatx:*
 
 ```
 interface Function<T,R>
 {
 public R apply(T t);
 }
 ```
 
Here T is the input parameter type and R is the return type.

Eg:

```
import java.util.function.Function;

public class FunctionExample1 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		// 1. Finding square of an integer

		Function<Integer, Integer> f1 = i -> i * i;
		System.out.println("Square of integer using function :" + f1.apply(10));

		// 2. Length of the string using function
		Function<String, Integer> f2 = s -> s.length();
		System.out.println("Length of String using function :" + f2.apply("shiva"));

	}

}
```


*Function Chaining :* Like predicate joining we can combine two functions to create one complex function and this is called as "Function Chaining"

Syntax:

1. f1.andThen(f2).apply(inputArgument) -- first f1 followed by f2

2. f1.compose(f2).apply(inputArgument) -- first f2 followed by f1

Eg:

Function<Integer, Integer> f3 = i -> 2 * i;
Function<Integer, Integer> f4 = i -> i * i * i;
System.out.println(f3.andThen(f4).apply(2));

O/p : 64.
